You can download the latest version (`superperforator-vX.X.X.html`) from the [latest releases](https://github.com/maddinkunze/superperforator/releases/latest) page and run it locally by simply double clicking on it. The program should open as a web page in your default browser. Please make sure your browser is supported and up-to-date. Older versions can be found in the [releases overview](https://github.com/maddinkunze/superperforator/releases).
This way, you can use the tool even without internet access.

#### "Building"

You can combine ("build") a single file by running the `combine.py` file within the `build` directory. You will need a recent python3 install to do so. A new file called `superperforator-vX.X.X.html` (the same as would be in the releases page) should appear in the `build` directory.
